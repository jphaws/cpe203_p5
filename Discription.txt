!!!NEW DEVELOPER MODE!!!
    We also created a developer mode where you can make maps without having to manually input points. When in dev mode
you will be able to add entities and remove entities. Once you are satisfied with your map placement of all the entities,
all you have to do is press the 'l' key and it generates the text you have to copy and paste into a file. Finally, all you
have to do it add it to a simple switch statement in Virtual World and your ready to play your new level!!!
    For the skeleton, gold, ghost, and furnace you will need to go into the file and add the animation and action period.

We still used the hierarchy of the entities. We still have abstract classes that help us keep our code sorted and clean.
We created an entity factory which creates the monsters. We decided not to include obstacles and thing that don't get
regenerated, so things that only gets parsed into the world from the file. We thought this would be more efficient and
smarter to do rather than having them go through the entity factory. It would save more time, and would be more efficient.
